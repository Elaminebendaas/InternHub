			Tasks to be completed by the student in the fall semester (i.e., now):

By Tuesday, September 18th at 12:00 PM: Prepare a CV (resume) and submit it to the internship coordinator (Sylvain Labranche).
Save it in "Word" or PDF format and upload it to the Moodle course page for "2018-2019: End-of-Studies Internships in Computer Science."
You must submit a single .ZIP file (no other formats accepted) named LastNameFirstName.ZIP (no spaces or accents in the file name).

Contact employers to offer your services.
You should reach out to at least three (3) employers, unless you have already secured an internship.
You should have at least three "meeting" forms, one for each employer you have met.

By Friday, November 2nd at 12:00 PM: Submit your completed "employer contact" and "employer meeting" forms.
Submit them on Colnet (in a .ZIP file, as mentioned above, and include all "contact" and "meeting" forms in Word format).

In the winter semester, to better understand the overall operation of end-of-studies projects (internships), I encourage you to explore the different sections of the website.
				




					<h3>Internship Process / Work Schedule</h3>
						The internships take place during the winter semester and last for 15 weeks, from January x to May y, 2024. You can find the details in the "Program Profiles, Dates, and Internship Specifics" section.

						During the internship, students are expected to follow the regular working hours of the company and employees in similar positions. In a typical workweek, interns are required to work between 35 and 40 hours. Students who do not fulfill the established number of hours in a regular week must make up for the missed hours by starting the internship earlier or finishing later (after an agreement with the internship coordinator and the supervising professor). Students who take advantage of this rule cannot exceed the internship presentation date.

						On pedagogical days and makeup days identified on the school calendar, interns are required to be present at the internship site. It is possible to start the internship earlier than the scheduled date, but only after an agreement between the student, the coordinator, and the employer (an internship cannot start earlier than the first Monday of January in the internship year).

						There will be two mandatory online meetings:

						Friday 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM in January before the start of the internships.
						Friday 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM around the middle of the internship (the exact date will be communicated later).
						Students are required to submit a weekly report describing their tasks for the week no later than Monday at 11:00 AM (it is suggested to submit the report on Friday afternoon to conclude the week). This report is emailed to the supervising professor. The format of the report will be discussed with the student's supervising professor.

						The supervising professor will contact the student (according to the pre-established schedule with the student) on a weekly basis. The supervising professor meets with the students every two weeks (unless there is a special arrangement with the company supervisor).

						At the end of the internships (usually during the evaluation week, one to two weeks after the internships), the interns will be required to present their final projects to the professors and other interns. Company supervisors are welcome to attend these presentations (interested individuals should coordinate the schedule with the supervising professor).
